## Code Clarifications
- The ```fetchMessages()``` function sorts all messages returned by the API call by alphabetical order of the sorted order of the sender and receiver's username, then by the date the message was created.
- The ```fetchMessages()``` function also groups messages by checking if the sender and receivers are the same two people.
